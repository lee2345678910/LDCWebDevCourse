        want to watch it."</i

      >which means <b>"The Fighting Spirit"</b>, a boxing anime I got invested
      in on the first day and once I started I didn't stop till it was done. I
      asked my mother if I could take boxing classes and she said yes! From
      there I went on to study about all the different styles and all the
      different variations of punches you could throw.
