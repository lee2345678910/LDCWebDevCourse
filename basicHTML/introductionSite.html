    <h1>Why He Loves Dogs more than Cats</h1>
    <p>
      For all the cats I have owned they were absolute demons. One was even
      named after a Japanese demon called Momo.

    <p>
      One day I was watching anime and my friend messaged me and said<i>
        "Hey, I know you like these kinds of things so I thought that you might
        want to watch it."</i
      >.

        ><b style="color: red">"Hajime no Ippo"</b></a
      >which means <b>"The Fighting Spirit"</b>, a boxing anime I got invested
      in on the first day and once I started I didn't stop till it was done. I
      asked my mother if I could take boxing classes and she said yes! From
      there I went on to study about all the different styles and all the
      different variations of punches you could throw.
